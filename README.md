## Question for Designing a Local Cache System

**How would you design a local caching system that efficiently handles high read and write loads while ensuring data consistency and optimal performance?**

### Key Areas to Address:

1. **Functional Requirements:**
    - **Data Retrieval:** How will the system handle read requests? What mechanisms will you implement to ensure low latency during data retrieval?
    - **Data Storage:** What strategies will be employed for writing data to the cache? Will you use write-through, write-behind, or another policy?
    - **Eviction Policies:** Which eviction strategy (e.g., LRU, LFU, FIFO) will you implement to manage cache size and optimize performance?

2. **Non-Functional Requirements:**
    - **Performance:** What measures will you take to minimize latency for both read and write operations?
    - **Scalability:** How will the system accommodate increasing data sizes or access patterns without significant performance degradation?
    - **Reliability and Fault Tolerance:** What approaches will you use to ensure high availability and data persistence in case of application crashes?

3. **Architecture Design:**
    - **High-Level Architecture:** Can you outline the major components of your cache system (e.g., Cache Manager, Cache Store) and their interactions?
    - **Data Consistency:** How will you maintain consistency between the cache and the underlying data source? Will you implement strong consistency or eventual consistency models?

4. **Capacity Planning:**
    - **Traffic Estimation:** How would you estimate the expected read and write traffic? What metrics would you consider for capacity planning?
    - **Storage Requirements:** How will you calculate the total storage needed for the cache based on data size and expected entries?

5. **Implementation Considerations:**
    - **Cache Warm-Up:** What strategies will you employ to ensure the cache is effectively warmed up before serving requests?
    - **Monitoring and Logging:** How will you implement monitoring for performance metrics and logging for debugging purposes?

6. **Security Measures:**
    - **Access Control:** What security measures will be in place to protect cached data from unauthorized access?

### Conclusion
This question encourages a comprehensive exploration of both functional and non-functional aspects of designing a local caching system. It allows for discussions around architectural choices, performance optimizations, scalability strategies, and real-world implementation challenges.
